## Test Driven Development:
* Describe: neighborhood()

* Test 1: "Return alert for invalid number"
* _Expect: (neighborhood("seven")).toEqual("Whoops!..."");_
* _Expect: (neighborhood()).toEqual("Whoops!..."");_

* Test 2: "Return a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number."_
* _Expect: (neighborhood(5)).toEqual(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

* Test 3: "If users inputted number contains a 1 convert it to 'Beep'".
* _Expect: (neighborhood(11)).toEqual(0, Beep, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Beep);_

* Test 4: If users inputted number contains a 2 convert it to 'Boop'"._
* _Expect: (neighborhood(12)).toEqual(0, Beep, Boop, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Beep, Boop);

* Test 5: "If users inputted number contains a 3 convert it to 'Won't you be my neighbor?'".
* _Expect: (neighborhood(6)).toEqual(0, Beep, Boop, "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6);_

* Test 6: "Return in order of 3 taking priority over 2 and 2 taking priority over 1."
* _Expect: (neighborhood(13)).toEqual(0, Beep, Boop, "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Beep, Boop, "Won't you be my neighbor?");_
